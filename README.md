📐 Project Structure & Implementation

HTML

The structure includes components for:
	•	Word display
	•	Wrong letter list

	•	Notification and popup messages

Semantic HTML ensures easy DOM manipulation and readability.

CSS

Used to design a clean and engaging UI with:
	•	Centered and responsive layout

	•	Smooth animations when revealing hangman parts

JavaScript

Implements the complete game logic:
	•	Random word generation
	•	Keypress event handling
	•	Updating correct/incorrect letters
